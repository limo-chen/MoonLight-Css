       <p> If I were to live the life twice.I would like to be a tree.Standing in
        the dust firmly,without happiness and sadness.A half of my body will be
        sleeping in the earth peacefully.A half of my body will be dancing with
        the wind joyfully.A half of my body will be providing green shade for
        passers-by willingly.A half of my body will be bathing in the sunshine
        warmly.So quiet and proud will I be.that I will not have to depend on
        anyone, searching for anything.
